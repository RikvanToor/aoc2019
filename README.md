# Advent of Code 2019

This is a Haskell implementation of part of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
To run it, simply clone this repository, navigate to the cloned directory and do `stack run`.
Day 13 is currently the most interesting implementation, in my opinion.
Running day 13 requires [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).
